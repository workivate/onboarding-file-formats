# LifeWorks Automated Onboarding - Supported File formats

The purpose of this repository is to provide assistance for producing valid input files for the onboarding process in a number of different formats. 

Currently we support [Comma-separated values (CSV)](csv/) format, but [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](json/) and [Extensible Markup Language (XML)](xml/) is on the way.
  
There is an explanation on what fields to use with what kind of contents, as well as examples, and schemas to validate an input file against. Although it is not guaranteed that an input file that is valid against the correct schema will be imported without errors, the schema validation can eliminate the vast majority of the potential errors so it could be a helpful part of the process.

## File requirements
* All files regardless of the file format must be UTF-8 encoded without BOM
* Files should have one of the following extensions: (xml, json, csv) indicating its format
* File should always contain ALL user records (including inactive/terminated users)
* Files should be added as new files and should not overwrite existing files held on the SFTP, therefore we recommend using a date & timestamp in the filename generation process

### Activation and termination dates
Those fields have a special meaning in our platform, and there is additional logic around those values:

**Activation date**:
 * can be edited only if current activation date is in future (user hasn't been activated yet)
 * activation date can't be set in past, (you can set any date that is later or equal to the current date)

**Termination date**:
 * can be edited only if current termination date is in future (account is still active)
 * termination date can be set only to future counting from midnight UTC on the day file has been sent for processing

### Primary key

**User** - Our system supports two types of primary keys - `employee_id` and `email`, at least one of those fields must be present and not empty. Our system will first try to use `employee_id` and then tailback to `email` if value of `employee_id` is empty. You MUST always use same primary key for all records. Changing the primary key without separate agreements cannot be supported. A change in primary key may result in account duplication or permanent removal. 

**Company** - Company is always identified by `company_id`.  `company_id` must not change, as that will trigger the removal of the existing network and creation of a new one.

## User-only files

The schemas for user-only files are named `user_import.*`. These are meant for validation of files that contain only employee records for a single company, so the `company_id` and `company_name` properties are not applicable in this case and should not be in the file.
